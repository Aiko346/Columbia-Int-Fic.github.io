<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <p>
            Haven't added real content, but this ended up being very simple! And we can link to the Twine chapters easily like so:  
        </p>
        
         <ul><li><a href="Test%20File.html">Chapter 1</a></li>
             <li>Chapter 2</li>
             <li>Chapter 3</li>
             <li>and so on...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And eventually CSS can be added to pretty this up.
        </p>
    </body>
