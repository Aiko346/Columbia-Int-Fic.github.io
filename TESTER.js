|p2)[So yesterday was crazy. And I mean CRAY-ZEE. I went to <span class="clickers" id="3">school</span> and everything was pretty normal. Well as normal as things could be. <span class= "clickers"  id="4">Mam and Dad</span> had told me that a school nearby had closed that week because the virus spread in it. They said I should be careful and not hug my friends or do my <span class= "clickers"  id="5">handshakes</span> with them in case someone had it. It was really awkward when Niamh came up to me to do our |txef>[handshake] and I had to step back and say I didn't want to. She asked me 'why?' So I just said I wasn't in the mood. I was afraid if I told her what Mam and Dad said she'd think that I thought she had the virus, which I don't. But it's hard to know isnâ€™t it? I heard that you can carry the virus but not be coughing or have a high temperature. Also in case she'd make fun of me or <span class= "clickers"  id="6">cough</span> in my face - some kids have done that in my class, and sometimes Niamh can copy others. It was fine though, I think she forgot about the handshake when we went to sit down.
